                <text>THE COCAINE MONSTER
THROWING HIS TENTACLES
AROUND THE NATION
HOW IT GRIPS ITS VICTIMS
The Deadly Drug Whose Influence
Carries Men to Insanity and
Death Becoming Too Popular
Value of cocaine leaves imported at the
port of New York in 1894.114,384; imported
in 1807, #54.122; indicated value ot imports
for 18SKS, $75,000.
In these simple figures are contained the
elements of a warning sermon that would
startle all America. We seem to be rapidly
becoming a nation of cocaine fiends, it the
number of those addicted to the u.-e ol the
dreadful drug continues to increase at the
present rate the importation of what "as
originally regarded its a blessed alleviator
of pain will have to be classed with opium
ami its use prohibited by law, except tor
medicinal purposes.
At present the cocaine Bend can pill-chase
the drug without trouble and the case with
which it is taken is a fatal recommenda
tion to those who crave a nerve-dcadener.
No laborious cooking of pills over a lamp,
cleaning of implements or troublesome neces
sity for secrecy, as with the use of opium.
Cocaine can be taken at any time, with
scarcely any trouble, anil without a soul
besides the being aware ot his being
in the toils.
At first, that is. It will not be long before
every intimate friend will observe c change,
a gradual ami scarcely perceptible change,
come over the appearance and general con
duct of the cocaine fiend. II the one who
yields to the toxic influence of the drug be
a lawyer, then it will be noticed that Ilia
language as he pleads a case in court has
become particularly diffuse, while his argu
ments are long drawn out and lacking in
logic. Others will notice this peculiarity
and wonder. The victim will be in hli'siul
ignorance of anything wrong, for another
queer phase of the progress ot cocaine pots-
Suing is that il lulls the user into a de
lightful feeling of self-satisfaction, and,
whatever his shortcomings, he is contented
ami happy—until the influence of the drug
departs and leaves him only with the dead
ly craving for more that none can tight oil.
The lecturer who becomes a victim to the
cocaine habit will, to the surprise ot his
audience, spend the enure period allotted
to a certain subject on a single insignificant
part of it, or seem to tot get the topic en
tirely and wander into something entirely
foreign. It will strike the listeners that
the learned lecturer has been drinking or is
beginning lo get feeble-minded, there will
be nothing in lie appearance or manner of
the speaker to indicate that he himself has
the slightest knowledge that he lias not
been treating the subject in the brightest
and most careful way. Cocaine is a drug
that deludes its victims. It i- the very devil
blmsell in tin form of an innocent-looking
crystal, and the way the much-to-be-pitied
cocaine user is dragged slowly, but with
aw ml certainty, down, toinsanitsand death
is a terrible tribute to the strength ol the
demon that links in ihe drug.
This confusion oi ideas and language is
the first symptom of the toxic influence of
the cocaine beginning lo work. It you have
a friend in whom these symptoms are no
ticed, il might be well to find out il he is
addicted 10 the use of cocaine, tor at this
early stage the habit may be broken. Later
it is almost hopeless for the victim to try
to sunder his chains.
Begun in many cases in a legitimate way,
as an anesthetic, the surprisingly pleasant
effect is sought, lor again by the one who has
had a glimpse ai Ihe portals of elysium. This i
is tbe beginning of the terrible habit. The i
effect is a sense of exhilaration followed by a
quiet, dreamy state that causes the worried
man to forget his troubles and the sufferer i
his pain. nn,.,. this freedom from physical
and mental sickness has been experienced,
the cocaine fiend will t 01. or kill to get the I
ding. Enforced non-use of it will not cure
the victim. Sentence him to a term ot'im
prisonment, ami he will go straight from
the jail door to the nearest drug store to
secure cocaine before he eats or sleeps. i
This, of course, cannot last. From an '
occcasional use of the drug to insatiable .
craving is the rational course of the cocaine <
fiend. From thence to the insane asylum i
anil the grave is a swift and easy descent. i

In his fall from health to physical and
mental disintegration the cocaine fiend un
dergoes a terrible experience. When not in
the temporary heaven that the drug pro
vides, the victim is in the lowest depths of
an infeino. He is subject to apprehen
sions, delusions and hallucinations. He suf
fers from insomnia, anorexia and gastralgic
latins, dyspepsia, chronic palpitations and
wiil-paresis. He is a terror both to himself
and others. The life of the man is a living
death. He knows it, nnd with this know
ledge -taring him in the face, he rushes for
the drug nnd is happy for a brief perftd
under its influence. It is time something
were done to keep from this high-strung
nation a drug so deadly. Clear-minded
medical men have recommended its exclu
sion from the country, believing that its use
medicinally should be foregone rather than
that such a cursed temptation should be
placed in tbe way of weak humanity.

                <text>DANGERS Of DEADLY COCAINE
Rapid Increase of the Most rnsidioiis Drug
Habit—The Craving Usually Acquired by
Accident
With the month of May comes the
opening of the six months harvest of
the soda fountains. "What will you
have?" asks the amiable clerk and
points to a list of sirups, a row of gayly
colored bottles and some large bowls on
the counter containing crushed straw
berries, sliced pineapple and other
I tempting fruits. If you stick to the
fruit sirups and the fruit is really good,
no harm is done. On the contrary-
But if you turn to the bottled attrac
tions or listen to the promise of their
much advertised qualities, then beware.
Here is plain warning from Dr. L. F.
Kebler, chief of the division of drugs
in the government bureau of chemistry:
"Attention is directed to the danger of
soft drinks containing caSeine, extract
of kola nut and extract of coca leaf, the
active principle of the two latter being
cocaine."
According to Dr. Kebler, scores of
soft drinks, dangerously medicated, are
sold at soda water fountains as stimu
lating and refreshing summer drinks
without the slightest intimation to pur
chasers that their stimulating and re
freshing qualities come from cocaine, a
drug that produces one of the worst
habits known to the medical prefession.
"We have seen," said Dr. Kebler,
"how the opium habit may be acquired
by the use of various proprietary or se
cret preparations usually employed as
domestic remedies, and so the cocaine
habit may be developed by the use of
these much lauded soft drinks."
During a recent visit to Washington
I talked with two heads of departments
in the bureau of chemistry, both active
in government prosecutions of drugged
soda water sirups. "There is no ques
tion," said one of these authorities,
"that the presence of cocaine in soft
drinks tends to create in the consumer,
whether child or adult, a predisposition
towards the cocaine habit."
It is evident that the manufacturers
of these soft drink sirups have only one
motive for putting cocaine into them —
that is to make them popular, to make
them taste good, to make them sell
better. And this popularity, this pleas
ant taste and better sale come simply
and solely because there is enough co
caine in these soft drinks to give some
thing of the stimulating and exhilarat
ing effect that cocaine always gives.
"It is not uncommon," says Dr.
Kebler, "to find persons addicted to the
use of medicated soft drinks. It is a
well known fact that many factory em
ployes, stenographers, typewriters and
others subject to mental or nervous
strain spend a part of their earnings for
drinks of this character. Parents, as a
rule, withhold tea and coffee from their
children; but, having knowledge of the
presence of cocaine, caffeine or other
deleterious agents in soft drinks, they
unwittingly permit their children to be
harmed by their use."
Cocaine —what is it? The Standard
Dictionary tells us: "Cocaine, a white,
bitter, crystalline alkaloid contained in
coca leaves; used in medicine as a
local anesthetic." And again: "Coca,
the dried leaves of a South American
shrub of the flax family, used in medi
cine as a tonic; chewed by tne native i
Indians as a nervine stimulant." There
is no connection between the coca
shrub and the cocoa palm tree that pro
duces cocoa nuts.
An ounce containg 480 grains and a
grain of cocaine is a dose. From a
single source of cocaine supply in New
York city 480,000 doses of this dan
gerous drug were illegitimately dis
pensed every month.
How is the habit usually acquired?
"By accident, like other drug habits.
I'm sorry to say that one of these —er
—accidents is the presence of cocaine
in catarrh medicines." Dr. Podstata
proceeded to give me details in the
case of one of his patients, a man of 22,
who became a cocaine fiend quite inno
cently by taking a widely advertised
"catarrh cure" that contained only a
small percentage of cocaine, but, alas,
enough to establish the habit. The
young man sniffed his "catarrh cure"
up his nose, and after each sniffing ex
perienced a characteristic sense of ela
tion, a peculiar well being. He took
more and more of the stuff and soon
{discovered that his exhilaration came
from cocaine in the powder. Now, it
was cocaine he wanted, not the catarrh
cure; and presently he began to take
the drug pure, sniffing it, after the man-
i ncr of adepts and finally learning to use
jit in hypodermic injections. Soon he j
! learned that the sensations were not at I
all pleasant. Far from it! Quick after
each period of intoxication came the !
i dread of reaction that calls for more and i
always more cacaine. The character
istic physical and moral deterioration
went on rapidly. The victim grew sal
low-faced, sunken-eyed, restless, irrita
ble. He lost ambition and persever
ance. He became a liar, a wreck, help
less and useless, and within a year he
was placed in an asylum.
Notice that all this came to pass be
cause a perfectly well-meaning young
man bought at a reputable drug store
in Chicago what was advertised as an j
excellent cure for catarrh. And before
he knew what he was doing and taking |
he had become a "coke fiend" and his
life was irretrievably ruined.
At Hull House, that haven of good
works in Chicago, I found impressive
corroboration of the statement that chil
dren easily fall into the cocaine habit.
Dr. Hamilton, a woman bacteriologist
of Hull House, made an investigation
among boys and young men in the
neighborhood and found that numbers
of them were regular users of the drug.
Dr. Hamilton found that the cocaine
habit had spread through one group of
seven boys. The youngest,Willie, was
coming home from school one day when
a negro who offered him a sniff of pow
der, saying it would make him feel
good. Willie sniffed the powder and,
as he expressed it, felt like a million
aire. The negro sold him what was
lelt of the powder in a little pill box
for IS or 20 cents, and told the boy he
would be around that corner every even
ing with more of the stuff. He also
suggested that Willie inform his boy
friends of the wonderful effects of this
powder. ' Willie went back to the cor
ner and bought more of the drug. He
wanted to feel like a millionaire. He
told his two brothers, young men of 17
and 18, and they tried the powder.
One by one four of their friends were
initiated until the group of seven was
formed. All seven became absolutely
demoralized; they quit going to school,
stopped work, stayed away from home
all night, going on regular cocaine de
bauches and spending as much as $7
in a single day for the drug. When
their money gave out they would pawn
their clothes, they would steal, they
would do anything to get more money
to buy more cocaine.
Through the earnest efforts of the
Hull House people these seven boys
were cured of the habit. Dr. Hamilton
thinks a cure is possible for the young,
though rarely possible for adults. Even
so, the effects of their long indulgence
in cocaine did them permanent injury.
Their power of resistence was enfeebled
and three of them died of tuberculosis.
It is a question, too, whether the others
have been quite sound mentally.
I talked with a husband and wife,
both "coke fiends," whom I found in
a filthy hovel on "Cocaine alley," the ,
foulest part of Chicago, and they both j
assured me that they thought nothing
of spending 84 or 85 a day for "dope." j
They might lack food, clothing, warmth,
decency, everything; but without co
caine they could not and would not
live. This husband, strange to say,
was a man of intelligence and nice in
stincts. He wore glasses and had a
fine brow. He was a carpenter by trade
able to earn good wages until he got
this habit. His wife, a shattered, shriv
eled, frantic creature (she was on the
verge of the cocaine "leaps" ), informed
me with a certain pride that she had
once been a famous dancer in the Black
Crook company.
In an adjoining hovel was a colored
—a tall, lithe, wild-eyed victim, who
said a dollar's worth of cocaine was only
enough for a few sniffs, it would scarcely
last an hour.
Pure cocaine, which is manufactured
freely in various cities, is worth about
84 an ounce. That is what crooked
cocaine merchants pay for it. Then he
retails the drug by the little pink pill
box full, or the little blue bottle full,
and by thus subdividing it gets for each
ounce 820 or 825. That is, when he
sells the stuff pure to those who want it
for "hypos" and know the difference;
but to the "sniffers" he sells the drug
half adulterated with acetanilid, a very
cheap powder that looks like cocaine,
and allows him to double his gain.
I Sometimes these vulture retailers will
| work off on very desperate, half-crazed
! "fiends" a quality of "dope" that is
two-thirds adulteration, which gives the
dealers a profit of 860 an ounce!
No wonder a flashily-dressed negTO,
known as the "coke king of Chicago."
i boasted that, if the police would leave
I him alone for a single year, he would j
retire with a fortune. And no wonder
Ihe has been able, by the devices of
| well paid lawyers, to get himself speedily
out of the Bridewell every time he has!
been sentenced there. Residents on j
the mean street where this nogro lives I
will tell you of smart automobiles draw
ing up before his close-barred, dingy
shanty, and of well-dressed men or veiled I
j women hurrying through the alley to a
1 back door. They knock and the door
I opens slightly. The caller deposits a ■
coin in the hand that appears in the
i opening and receives in return a small
: box of cocaine. A chain guard pre
vents the caller forcing the door open
| more than a few inches. It is always j
quite a trick, the detectives say, to
I "catch these cocaine dealers with the
goods."</text>

Professor Dlekman attacked Mayor

and appeared frlghtfully agltated when
ever any one e-xpectorated on the eide
walk, but that lt did not seem to be
doing much to stamp out this evll, which
was laylng ita heavy hand on the city'a
youth.
t'ommlssioner Lederle of the Health De
partment shlfted the blame along to the
police by eaylng that the Btate law had
M.perseded the Health Department ordl
nance, and that lt would be foollsh to
proaoeatO a man for a mlsdemeanor under
the ordlnanco when he could be prose
cuted for a felony under the law.
Commissioner Waldo, whose department
recelved the whole weight of the respon
slblllty by this argument. appeared
stunned by the burden. He made no at
tempt to shlft lt or explaln why the law
was not more strlctly enforced.
The position of the State Board of Phar
macy ln the matter waa more clearly out
llned by Its president, Olarence O. Blgc
low, of this clty. He said that slnce the
1310 amendment the hands of the board
were absolutely tled ao far aa any en
forcement of the law went. All that the
board could do now, he aald, waa to hear
complaints on vlolatlons of the pharmacy
law and, lf there seemed to be sufflelent
evldence to lndlcate a vlolatlon. turn the
matter over to the Attorney General for
direct action.
The board has only three inspectors at
work ln this clty and one more upsUte,
he said. He asserted thlB force was ut
terly unable to cope with a altuation Uke
the cocaine evll, and that even with more
Inspectors the board could do nothlng, ex?
cept with the authority of the Commls
ajonsf of Educatlon, ln whose department
the Board of I'harmacy ls.
Authority la Too Dividad.
Thla weakness ln the sltuatlon waa em
phasized by George Kleinau, president of
the German Apotheeary Society, who de?
clared that tho whole system waa a botch.
Mr. Kleinau ?>ald he had been going up
to Albany for fourteen years advocating
laws which were so changed when th*y
ihially came through the t.eglBlature that
thulr effect was completely spolled. lt
w.i* BBOBBBIITi he polnted out, to have a
single authority charged wltb the en
(oraBBMfld of the cocaine law. He thought
tho beat authority for this purpose would
be the Hoard of Pharmacy, provided Its
appolrument should be taken out of the
boada of tho Bogaato and given to th?
Qoaroraoa*. The right to admtnlster law?,
Mr. kleinau held, should not be vested
In ti.e BogOBt-i slnce they ou_ht to be a
purely educatlunal body.
Dr. William 0. Anderson, president of
the New Vork Pharniareutlcal Confer
.-n. ?*, was also of thr* opinion that the
prooOBt laws were -Ultlcient, if the police
WOUld enforce them.
"It would pay the clty to put apeclal
dotOCtrroa on the trall of the 'coke' aell
ers," ho said, "and stamp out the trad.
by tho mo-t vigoroua measurea. Tha
Tribune could not be engaged ln better
vaork than leadlng publlc opinion In a re

The punlahment of the trafflcker In co

?_t to the man who rnenaces Bociety with
a revolver or a stlletto, according to Dr.
William H. Guilfoy, reglster of the De
pai tinent of Health.
"Instead of lettlng such persons off
with shurt terma of lmprisonment," said
Dr. t'.uilfoy, "they should recelve the m.st

Church of the Preaentatlon, at Eastern
Parkway and Ot Mark's avenue, in the.
h^art of Brownaville section, told a ]
reporter for The Tribune last night
that he had heard Randolph's name
mentioned by the members of a bdya'
chib he has formed, aa a seller.
Father Flynn haa been an ardent
worker against the Insldloua growth of
the cocaine traffic in hia pariah, and hia
campaign haa dleclosed to him that the
agents who promote it have not
scrupled to create a demand for It
among children between thlrteen and
seventeen years old.
"I know of at least 100 children be?
tween thlrteen and seventeen years old,"
said Father Flynn, "who have been
habltual cocaine or heroin users. They
cven rarry it into their schoolrooma,
concealed in hollow penclla and watch
cases. and, in Bome inatancea, in fake
handages which were wrapped around
suppoaed cuts on their flngers."
The clergyman said that he had no
douht whatever but that the coacaine
sellera. eapeclally those who sold the
drng to young girls, were in league
with the agenta of the "white alave"
traffic.
"I know that young girls have been
Btupefled with the drug and then taken
to dlsorderly housea," he said, "and I
belleve that the agents of the 'white
ala\e' traffic are behind the cocaine
trafflC Hanglng is too good for theae
wre'ches. Qod help the poor souls too
weak and the young mlnds too frail te
grasp the terrlble meanlng of thia habit
and its awful conaequences."
Father Flynn has organlied a boys'
club ln his parish on non-dcnomina
tional llnes whlch now has three hun
dred members. Every one of theae
young fellows Is pledged to report to
Fhthcr Flynn cven the most apparently
trlfiing suaplclous clrcumatances which
he observes along the linc of cocaine
selllng.

"Juat I few nights ago I waa told of a
boy who waa walking along the street
ln a hnlf stupefied condition, and when
I found him he had twelve 'decks' of

my own physlclan, as I have taken

Cocaine ia being aold in randy atore.
and small frult atores as well aa drurc
atores in the Brownsville section, Fa?
ther Flynn said, and it will take the
most vlgoroua klnd of a campaign to
eradlcate it.
"Probahly the most pltlable fenture
of this despicable traffic is tlie street
seller, who not only supplles the drug
to coiiflrmed users, but slso goes out of
hia t\ay to Induce young people, boys
and girla, to try it. so aa to make th. ?
ooatonaan also," he said. "I have re
c. ived complaints from parents 'hat
their (hildren aeemed to be dull in
their arhool work, and when I would
talk to the tatchatl about the i aaea I
would be told that the teachera had
n.ade up their mlnds that the children
had been kept up late at night, or had
too maiiv dutiea around the home.
"Purther Investigatlon dlacloaed that
these backward children were cocaine
fiends, aad ln avety case i found that

of the Greatest

and Heroin Dead-
?k lies t of Habit Form
n . : r
ON'K morning in January a woman undertook
ono of the greatest moral struggles in his
tory. Quietly announcement was made from
2 Rccir street that MrH. William K. Vanderbilt had
pliio i ,i m-nerous nurn of money at the disjosal
of t-i K Coulter and a staff of investigators to
ue 1 'ui- campaign for the extermination of drug
adili' 'mil not only in the city and State of New York
but 'l.ioughout the United States.
So swiftly has this vice grown that tho United
States -iiis distanced every other nation in tho world
in tin Imu j,er capita of its illegitimate drug con
mip .in The commerce in cocaine, heroin, mor
pliiin im opium now approximates the opium traffic
of i 'n n China history's most notorious example

No other vieo renders its victim so dangerous.
Opium, morphine und hasheesh pond their viutims
searching fo solitude, but u sniff of cocaine after
lifting Its victim into a half hour's losy overestima
tion drops him into tho streets and alleys in a state
of dangerous melancholia. So brief is the drug's
effect that it ta' es from i to $! u day to satisfy a
cocaine addict more nion y lian any other" drug
addiction exacts, That's why "coke" produces more
criminals in the city of New York than any other
single cause.
No other country in tho world knows the cocaine
habit. "Cocaine addiction is an American habit,"
says Dr. Charles U. Towns of 110 West Kighty-first
street, a recognized authority. "It is tho result of
our high pressure of living, our craving for over
stimulation, our proiienoss to 'take something' when
wo don't feel well. I have never known an Italian, a
Hungarian, a Itussiau, a Pole and only a few Jews
(except in the underworld) who took drugs."
"Cocaine addiction is the easiest habit to acquire
and the hudest to cure," say- Dr. PoiNtata, a Chi
engo drug expert. "Nothitur so iii kly deteriorate
its victim or provides o short a cut to the in-ano
asylum," says Dr. Towns, liccnu-c it takes such a
liiick, deadly grip of its victim then- ate some physi
cians who refuse to ndmini-tcr any cocaine what
ever', even ill legitimate medical piuctiee , Yet any
crook can bring a carload of cocaine fiom Philadel
phia into New York city, and the Interstate Com
merce Commirsion is owerless to interfere.
Notwithstanding its vitiating effects the growth
of cocaine add.etiou is indicated by the i:tc, easing
import into the United States of coca leaves, the
only source of cocaine and tin product of a shrub
which cannot be grown here. According to t e
American Pharmaceutical Association the oca iri
Iort from l.S'JS to 11102 inclusive was valued at fM.'.'l 1,
from lWO to 1007, inclusive, $1.11111 liini. The ;r - it
annual cousin ptiou of cocaine i L'nn.nno u ce-. , ,
which 02 per cent, is used illegitimately ior 1 ve.y
man, woman and child in the United State-, a s '.'
of cocaino sufficiently strong to kill -evera! m d.i"
Its enormous profit explains the growth of t'.e
cocaine business. An ounce of cocaine, wholes... ,
costs about $1. Divided into pink pill boxes 111, d I
bottles the ounce is sold without adulteration l"r
from $20 to to tho-e who use the needle and ki on
tho difference. Adulterated heavily wit iicetani'..!
it is sold to "sniffers" lor from J into $v 1 ounce and
half crazed fiends on the verge of the "1 u nine leap-"
can be made to yield even gi eater piolit. Thus
profits ranging from .VX) to i,.VM per cent, on the
investment have entrenched the cocaine business
011 a nationwide scale.</text>

The widespread net' of cocaine In
tlie comparatively short period of
time since It.i discovery," sas J)r.
Towns, "has been brought about by
patent preparations coutalr'ng small
quantities of II."
During Its tlrst few years cocaine nd
illction spread through the wld" soli' of
"catarrh cures." which contained from 2
to 4 per cent, of cocaine. These "cures,"
according to Samuel Hopkins Ad. mis In
Ciilliri'i UVi'Afjr, were "Dr. Ilirncys Ca
tarrh Cure," "Dr. Colo's Catarrh Cure."
"Dr. Agnow's Caiairh Powder" and
"Crown t 'atari li Powder." Not only did
these "euro." Introduce many pcions
Into depth of cocaine addiction, but
they pointed the way to a method of j
taking cocaine easier than by hypo- 1
dermic.
For u time It became the practice to
fill Willi the "cure" a small bottle1
through the cork of which had been In-M-r'etl
it wo tubes, one of which was
placed In the mouth and the other In
the nostril; u puff from' the mouth did
the rest. Later It became the custom to
sprinkle the "cure" on. the back of the
hand and either 'to touch It to the
tongue or to sniff It onto the mucous
membrane of the nostrils. Tims the
deadliest of all vices became the Minplcsl
to begin.
Among the thousands who contracted
cocaine addiction through the innocent
putchase of a patent medicine was Mrs,
Anna ('. .Meyers, who was prominent
socially In Chicago and In lsim was a
member of the board of managers of
the Chlcngo World's Fair. In a confes
siou detailing the career of crime Into
which cocaine plunged her Mrs. Meyers
Mays: "I used to get the little boxes of
the drug and call it 'my baby' and 'my
only friend,' cry over It and laugh and
dance like an Insane person."
It Is asserted that per cent, of
America's drug addicts learned their
vice In a doctor's olllce. Hundreds of
disreputable physicians make a practice
of giving morphine promiscuously for
their patients' iicIick, out of their olllees
Issues a constant procession of young
drill, addicts "Not more than 10 per
cent, iif all the drug addicts have any
incurable disease that would Justify fur
ther use of the drug." says Dr. Towns.
The use of drugs has crept Into colleges,
where students take them tn counter
act the effects of overwork; tfiey liavo
crept Into the army, where soldiers take
them ltd counteract the effects of under
work. "Many great writer to use a
current critical phrase," su's Dr. T. D.
Crothers of Hartford, Conn., "begin the
use of cocaine that they may whip their
Inventiveness to action."
Walters in restaurants use drugs to
quicken their memory. It has been
estimated that 1." per cent, of all the
medical men in the United States are
drug addicts, "One
half of nil my drug
patients ore physi
cians," says Dr.
Towns, who has u

I It lb asserted. This anti-opium legn.-

I cooked Into smoking opium here.
The opium poppy began to be grown
m California; licenses were taken out
under the act of 1S90 for the American
manufacture of smoking opium, and
Miioklng opium actually began to ! ex

The effect of a tariff Increase In abat

Dr. Abraham Ollcksteln. now, in the
Atlanta pcnltcntitiry. was one of these
disreputable physicians. He not only
wrote drug prescriptions, but tilled them
himself. He bought 9,3110 ounces of
cocaine between December 9, 19a. and
January 30, 1913, although thousands of
doctors use less than one ounce In a
lifetime. I tut this was perfectly legal.
It was Dr. lllcksielu's opium Indiscre

bie physicians ore striving to lessen
this evil to the best of their ability
"I do think the wholesale drug

ef this evil As an example of how

The terrible stream under Whli h

II Is ibe intention of the United

cocaine for commission of the

great profit from the misfortunes of

The smaller offenders are the men

their master, the man in control of
ihe supply, for a commission on

him and he owns them body and

colony of cocaine and morphine
users in a miserable row of tene

Filipino Row, and so filthy and foul
that no human being, unless under
the Influence of drugs, would live

There were men and women of all
types found there. Sturdy men who
worked hard in the daytime so that
in the night they might supply them
selves with drugs, and women who
Hacrificed everything so that they,
too might satisfy Hiis craving. There
were women still showing marks of

more than derives enough money to

she craves.
While living another life she
might be prominent socially and

that she knows the cocaine-nends

has money and she thinks that some

murder her for her money.
In all of (he misery and filth that
surround her, she is not more mis

Col N'utt and other revenue offi

living in the most unsanitary of

money to buy drugs. A negress ws
found laboring over the wash

that her efforts might earn for her
the drug she would crave In lho

under the Influence of drugs, was at

the chief say, hut it lasted only for a
time, and they evidently have become
emboldened again.
The arrest of habitual users of mor
phine and cocaine has been frequent
for the last two weeks, and this leaib
the police to believe that It is not as
difficult for them to procure "snow

following the prosecution of several
dealers.
A fart (hat gives rise to the belief
among the police that several drug

Is not only the "regulars" w ho appear
in court. Strangers here have been
arraigned In court as "drunks," but
their symptoms Indicated that their
"Jag" more probably came through 11

If conditions continue, the police
probably will begin a methodical
probe. There are many difficulties,
howevar," that annoy the police in
making an Investigation of this kind.
The evidence of a person addicted to
the use of drugs does not go at par
value In court, mid it is hard to de
tect a druggist In the act of making
a sale. A pharmacist could sell the
stuff in 11 crowded store and no one
but he nnd the pirchaser would know
what the package contained.</text>

Cocaine was so clearly the cause of a ieccnt "race riot" at
Mississippi, as to lead to some frank editorial utterances in
'egard to it. Thus the Columbia, South Carolina, State wondeis why
the "consistent and thoughtful (I) lyncher" does not in sucha case
think of lynching also the person who sold the drug to tjie
negro hoys who killed the seven citizens or Harriston. The
Memphis also admits that the law against the
sale of cocaine is a dead-letter, that its violation is "one of the greatest
curses of the Southland," and that it often is responsible for a
"frenzied lunacy." Jt quotes a physician. as declaring that there is
. iiough cocaine sold in Memphis every day "to supply the legitimate
use of physicians and surgeons for live years." Tlio Mobile Kegistei
declares that the sale of cocaine to negroes is a crime against society
as well as against the law. Unfortunately, comments the Nation,
New York, the constant convictions in this city for the illegal sale
Mof cocaine, show clearly that the evil is not confined to the South oi
io one race. The whole question of the stopping of this traffic is of
the utmost moment everywhere, for of late it has been gaining
ground with startling rapidity.</text>

Anna May Wong, and It marked her first work ns n screen nctress. It was
while hunting "tjpes" for his production that Marshall Neilnn discovered Anna
May and finally induced her father to nllow her to forsake her shlrt-pinnlng
activities nt least during the day.
Since then Anna Slay has foimd herself in great demnnd among movie
producers, for in addition to being an exceptional "tjpe" she has unu-ual talents
"Outside the Law" and "Shame" are other films in which she appeared, and
then Mnrshall Neilan again took her to his studio for the co-star part opposite
Lon Chaney in "Hits of Life."
Anna May Wong in her laundry home, my friend writes me, lookw just as
he docs on the screen. Quiet, beautiful nnd industrious, Anna May pins t.hirt
and adds figures with equal djesterity. Once at home her movie fairjland i
forgotten In the reality of hard work to be overcome before she again dons her
finery and plays the queen.
There is a difference, however, between this Chinese Cinderella of the movies
nnd tho Cinderella of old. Unlike her predecessor, Anna May Wong loves her i
mental duties at home. She has grown up in an atmosphere of industry, for
any one who has ever lost n collar knows that tho ramifications of a Chinese i
laundry demand ceaseless activitj. Anna May's laundry is a machine of human
parts, ns complicated as one of springs nnd wheels. The wash goes in one end
and vanishes, the shirts one way. the collars another, the socks here, the under
clothing th'ere. And then they all come out together in neat piles.
"Whether the producer needs n Chinese slave girl or a princess, Anna May
always qualifies In her inovla work.</text>

Oye, Anna Hay Wong:
"Los arroyos y las colinas son
ríen en la gloria <le la primavera;
el luminoso sol envuelve las arbo
ledas; la brisa se lleva las flores
que caen; la nube solitaria se acer
ca a la montaña, y los pájaros se
aproximan a sus nidos.
‘Todos los seres y todas las co
ras tienen un asilo donde ir; pero
yo soy una hiedra que no tiene un
Arbol al cual enroscarse ni un mu
ro al cual asirse.
"Por eso, así. bajo las estrellas
del tiempo en que florecen los cri
santemos, canto a la fragante flot
y estrecho tu imagen contra mi co
razón, ¡oh Flor de las Aguas!, ¡oh
Flor de la Luna!...”
Yo no tenía un violín de una cuer
da, Anna May Wong, para cantar
te esta melancólica y apasionada
canción que hace mil años, en el
umbral de una pagoda, compuso un
ruiseñor del tiempo de Coiifuclo.
Pero te la cantaba desdi' lejos, con
la misma pasión con que la canta
ha el pobre C'heng Hueng—que aho
ra está, en el Paraíso —cuando vió
pasar por el muelle carcomido del
Yang Tse Kiang la muchachita de
los ojos como almendras y la cari
ta de luna.
Y después de más de mil años, yo
era C'heng Hueng. el poeta solita
rio y errante que dormía y cantaba
en el umbral de, las pagodas, y tú.
Anna May Wong, eras la Mariposa
Azul que gastaba sus diminutas
sandalias color sangre en la Fiesta
do las Linternas y en el Desfile de
los Dragones.
Lirio del río: Wang Li, aquel a
siátlco que lavaba y planchaba ro
pa en un conventillo del Dock Sur,
y que fué mi grande y fiel ami
go. mo enseñó la canción de Cheng
Hueng. Fue él también quien me
explicó, con los brazos llenos de ja
bón y el semblante sudoroso, cómo
so ama en el país de lo» arrozales,
y cómo cada mil años las almas
do los amantes regresan, lo mismo
que las golondrinas en los veranos.
Y así regresamos nosotros, Anna
May Wong. Y yo te seguí amando
como aquel ladrón en la callejuela
misteriosa de Bagdad, cuando eras
esclava, y yo era esclavo de tu mi
lenario corazón, que entonces esta
ba floreciendo de nuevo en la. pe
numbra olorosa de un lavadero de
ropa, en un callejón de San Fran
cisco. léjos. a muchos millares de
leguas de los arrozales y de los
crisantemos.
Y yo soñaba contigo, Anna May
Wong: en la pasión misteriosa de
tus ojos chinos; pensaba en qué
estrellas anduviste durante diez cen
lucias con tus piecesitos sin sanda
lias-
Pero ni en Buenos Aires ni en
San Francisco había pagodas para
interrogar a los dioses sobre el se
creto milenario do nuestras pere
grinaciones solitarias.
¿Nunca, Anna May Wong, llegó
hasta tu corazón inmemorial el eco
remoto do mi renovada canción de
amor?
Hasta la ventana de tu suntuoso
hotel de Los Angelíes, ni la calle bu
lliciosa de Hollywood, ¿no llegó nun
ca el suspiro lejano del poeta del
Sur?
Y sin embargo mi canción tenía
M murmullo del agua cuando pasa
cantando entre los arrozales de Mon

como las canciones do los mendi

many years to the marriage of her mother and

Her father lived in Sunning. Canton, China.
And her mother came from Northern China
near Peiping. Immediately after their marriage
they migrated to Los Angeles, where Wong ex

• Chinese private school.
Many times Anna May and her sisters ob
jected to the strenuous study and work forced
upon them. Why should they learn to read,
write and speak Chinese? What good would It
do them? Their father merely replied that It
was his wish that his children should know the
language of their ancestors.
“I am very glad now that father insisted
upon us studying ChineseJi- the charming ac
tress says. “Had I not done so I would have
missed much that is beautiful in life. I now
knew the wisdom and philosophy of my people
through the knowledge of their language.
Father knew what was ahead of us. How
- wise he was!"
Vacations never were favored by the head
of the Wong family As a result the children
always attended Summer school. Consequently
when Anna May entered high school she was
the youngest student in that institution—and,
you might say, the smartest
Piano study was added to her list of high
school subjects at this time, leaving her little
time to dwell upon her secret longing to be
come an actress.
This longing was of several years duration,
dating back to a Chinese New Year celebra
tion when she was six years old and her father
took his family to their first picture show.
“To this day I can remember in detail the
six pictures that were shown that night for
live cents per person,” declares Miss Wong.
• Pearl White was in a serial. Eddie Polo was
in another picture There was a Keystone eop
comedy and a melodrama that gave me night
mares for a week afterward."
During her third year in high school. Anna
May suffered a nervous breakdown. The fam
ily's Chinese physician prescribed rest under
the sun. true to the traditions of his people,
who believe that the sun will cure many ail
ments Pot weeks afterward Anna May haunt
ed the beaches and parks in search of health.
But she tired of spending long hours doing
nothing but sitting So she ssked her oouain,
James Wong, a film actor, to take her with
to the studio This James consented to
do, always her with him whenever he
had a locatVy" call so that she could remain
in the freeh air That was before the stuthos
became ae particular about having visitors
around.

would wander over to where she was sitting
and engage her In a conversation for a few
moments at a time.
The man was Marshall Neilan, at that time
one of Hollywood's beat directors. It was huge
ly through him that Anna May s life took a
sudden turn and she found herself a scree*
actress, far better known within a very short
time than her cousin James.
There was some consternation in the Wong
household when Anna May came home one
night and told of an offer she had received
from Neilan to play a role in a picture, "DUsty.'’
which he was about to start.
Wong and his wife sat up that night long
after the children had retired, discussing the
proposition from all angles. They knew that
she would abide by their decision if they ob
jected to her taking the role. But would it be
quite fair to rob their daughter of such an
opportunity? The following morning Wfcng
V called his daughter and said:
"I haven’t much faith in these things called
moving pictures. Yet the most honored pro
fessional men in all China are acton. If feu
will take your sister with you as a chaperon
and get home every night in time for eur
evening meal you may accept the offer.”
Little did he realize when he made that
statement that within a few years his daugh
ter's name would be dancing In electric lights
the world over.
When Anna May first stepped In front of
the cameras her fears were unbounded. But
she soon was made to feel at ease by the Bnd’
ness of Neilan and her fellow players, Wesl-jf
Barry. Marjorie Daw, Pat O'Malley and Noah
Beery.
"Dinty” placed the young Chinese girl well
on the road to success. No sooner had it been
released than she was deluged with offers from
casting directors in every studio. For more
than a year she was kept constantly busy and
her salary continued to grow.
She easily was earning enough to take her
family from their laundry house quarters, but
th y preferred to stay there, and Anna Mag
stayed with them.
Then she signed a contract with a motion
picture company operating in San Francisco.
The company was unable to raise the necessary
money for their production, but they refused
to release Miss Wong until the termination of
her contract one year later. Thus she was
kept off the screen entirely for one year.

' This shows the face and hands of Anna May Wong, young
Chinese actress, born in the United States. There could be
no better arrangement of a photograph to show, in condensed
•pace, the spirit dwelling within.
From the face and the hands you learn more than from all
the rest of the body, all, in fact, that you need to know.
The eyes reflect the mind and spirit, the mouth reveals
emotions, cold, passionate or neutral.
The forehead, in this case too much concealed, is most
important of all, for that which is back of the forehead is
really THE HUMAN BEING.
As for the hands, they tell a thousand stories. The fingers,
long, tapering, with the hand itself narrow, show what we
call "refinement,” the absence of hard work through a num
ber of generations.
Fingers blunt at the end, with broad nails, tell one story.
Too much "refinement” in the hands may show that a
person belongs to a family dying out, losing energy. Refine
ment is admirable, but there must always be STRENGTH, to
make refinement efficient and useful.
In the thumb alone you may read character.
According to the Kiralfy brothers, theatrical men of long
ago, you can tell from the thumb the shape of the whole body.
The Kiralfys, producing the "Black Crook,” and other per
formances in which young ladies were displayed in tights, in
the old days, needed young ladies with well-shaped legs.
But the Kiralfys said: "All we need to see is the girl’s thumb.
As soon as we see the thumb we know just how she will look
in tights.” This, presumably, saved the young ladies apply
ing for jobs some embarrassment, and saved time for the
Kiralfys.
Study hands and faces, eyes for sincerity, the chin for
force of character, the ears for generosity, or the reverse, the
mouth for emotion, the forehead for intelligence, the hands
for the physical and racial past, and you study a human
being completely.
In addition, you will be interested in this young face, com
bining the mystery of the East with the Western influence of
birth in this country.</text>

alar, la In the land of her ancestors
now — for the first time in her life
Born and reared In Los Angeles.
the American Chineae girl who sup
plied the Oriental allure to the mo
tion picture industry for 15 years,
had her first glimpse of China here
the other day when she stepped ofi
the gangplank of a liner from San
Francisco
She plans to pa* a year in the
Orient. After seeing Hongkong and
Canton and after visiting her mother
and sisters whom she hasn't seen
for years. Miss Wong will travel
throughout the country to see the
‘real" China, not the China she
knew In the movies, from books and
from hearsay.
Hopes to Learn Language
Incidentally she hopes to leam
the Chines* language, but she un
derstands It Is difficult.
Rumors of a romance accompanied
her arrival here. Fellow passengers
on the steamer whispered Into ship
news reporters’ ears when the liner
docked that the son of a millionaire
Canton merchant was waiting for
her to be his bride. No such thing.
Miss Wong denied promptly. She Is
"wedded to her art."
No Movte Actress Airs
There Is none of the movie actress
airs abcut demure, placid Anna
Wong. She scorns make-up—a lit
tle lipstick Is her only concession—
snd she has some ideas of her own
concerning the things she wears.
"Years of experimenting with
western clothing have convinced me
that the only colors that really suit
Orientals are black and white." she
said. "It Is ridiculous for us to ac
cept bllndl; the current fashions of
New York and Paris."
As if In demonstration, she was
wearing an almost severe black suit
with white waist, an outfit the sim
plicity of which was well suited to
her aopearance and manner.
Her Opinion of Hollywood
Hollywood?
"What the mo* »e capital needs is
freshness, freshness in everything
characters, plots, actors and ac
tresses.” she asserted. "No wonder
such stars as Garbo and Dietrich
had such meteoric success
"The adaptation of commonplace
stories no longer satisfies cinema
audiences, and producers are in
creasingly looking abroad for un
usual material, which opens further
opportunities for foreign playera.
"When the talkies came everyone
thought the foreign actors then In
Hollywood would be thrown out of
Jobs because they couldn’t speak
English without an accent. It didn't
work out that way arid now foreign
players are In demand for films with
foreign backgrounds Just because of
that accent.
Real Accent Needed
Tor example. In a film with a plot
laid In China, no American actor
trying to impersonate an Oriental
can fake an accent properly. Under
such circumstances there is In
creasing opportunity for Orientals to
win a place for themselves in the
films in competition with western

In Extortion Plot
HOLLYWOOD, March 24*
(I.N.S.).—A bizarre extortion plot,
involving Anna May Wong, Chi
nese film star, and the family of
Producer David O. Selznick, was
revealed by police here today.
Both Miss Wong and Mrs. Selz
nick received threatening notes
demanding $20,000. Heavy police
guards were placed about their
homes today. At the same time
police revealed they were hold
ing Dr. E. J. Foote, chiropractor,
as a material witness in the case.
Dr. Foote himself turned over a
similar extortion note in which
he was instructed to obtain the
money from Miss Wong and Mrs.
Selznick and “hold it for the
gang.”
His name appeared below the

CONFESSES
- HOLLYWOOD, March 26 (I.N.
S.). —Arresting one woman and
.announcing they had cleaned up
,a new phase of the case, author
ities today were still confronted
.'with the bizarre extortion plot
.directed against Anna May Wong,
;Chinese screen star, and Mrs.
David O. Selznick, wife of the film
■producer.
1 A middle-aged woman from Du
luth. Minn., was arrested and
charged with writing a new threat
note to Evangelist Aimee Semple
McPherson.
At the same time police re
vealed that the evangelist received
another note yesterday signed “A.
M. Foote.” the same signature
that appeared on the notes re
ceived by Miss Wong and Mrs.
Selznick.
The suspect, who gave her name
as Mrs. Lydia Swenson, 51, was
arrested in her home. After
lengthy questioning she confessed,
stating:
"I needed S2OO for the down
payment on a new car.”
One of the notes received by ;
the evangelist demanded that'
amount and conveyed a warning
of “The Black Hand.”
Officers admited, however, that i
Mrs. Swenson could not have had ■
any connection with the other
note received by Mrs. McPher
son, nor with those received by
the film figures.
The second note received yester
day by Mrs. McPherson demanded
that she meet the writer to dis
cuss a biblical picture which he
planned to produce.
In the two notes to Mrs. Selz
nick and Miss Wong the writer
demanded $20,000 from each, to
aid him in producing the picture.</text>

                <text>Anna May Wong Is Ready
To Resume Picture Career
Actress, Playing Here, Tires of Pvetirement
and Would Return to Screen, But
Not as Villainess.
, BY HARRY Mac ARTHUR.
HERE'S one motion picture star who was brought up on the way*
of old and won't cast aside the traditions of the Hollywood of the past
When she stepped from a train yesterday afternoon at Union
Station, Anna May Wong, the young ladv who’s played more
Oriental villalnesses than Myma Loy and five other actresses, was told she
had reservations at two different hotels. Which one did she want to
keep? .
“Oh. keep ’em both, she replied,
blandly indifferent to the fact that
getting even one hotel reservation in
this town is often an achievement of
no little note. "There’s no use being
crowded.”
Renewing her acquaintance with
* Linton Wells, meeting Broderick
Crawford, chatting pleasantly with
them, Miss Wong says she's about
over the effects of those recent
• extortion threats.
It took something of a breakdown
at Palm Springs to let all of the
> nerves out of her system, she admits,
but now all is well. When she first
received the threats on her life, she
tightened up inside and didn't let
off steam. Could have loosened
things up by tossing a bit of furni
ture around, she knows, but she was
at a friend's house and felt it would
not be joropeT to toss a friend's furni
ture about.
* * * *
T^OW she’s going back to work.
For the last couple of years
Miss Wong lias been loafing, trying
to kid herself into thinking she’s
retiring, she calls it. But it hasn’t
agreed with her and she's putting an
end to loafing right now with a pair
■* of stage appearances—one here at
the Capitol and the other in New
York.
New York, she likes, because it puts
her in contact with people who are
doing things. Seems to have given
her a desire to get back in the lists,
so *he probably will be homing back
to the Paramount studios before many
moons.
The only reason she decided to
retire from films In the first place,
•ays Miss Wong, was this business

'J'HE seeming endless succession of
unsympathetic roles rubbed her
the wrong way until, she says, she
was afraid she was going to begin
to believe them herself. She’s not
different from any other girl. Miss
Wong claims, and she doesn't see why
she can't be a heroine Just once.
When she does go back to Holly
wood, however, there will be better
things in store. The studio finally
is planning to do a series of detective
yarns, with Miss Wong on the right
side of the law and not the lass who
leers around a comer and lures the
hero to his doom.
It’s an idea she's been trying to
sell to the studio for a long, long
time, and the first scripts, she says
look good.
JUSTICE IS PROMISED
FARMERS OF MEXICO
By the Associated Press.
MEXICALI, Lower Calif., Mav 6 —
Seven thousand small-scale farmers,
encamped about the Governor's palace
here lor nearly two weeks in protest
against the government's agrarian
program, awaited today a reply to
their appeal for government relief.
Juan Beulna, president of the group
said they were 3.000 pesos in debt to
Mexicali merchants, who had ex
tended credit, as well as making out
right contributions. He declared a
3-month-old baby died in the camp
Tuesday night from what a doctor
diagnosed as malnutrition of its
mother.
A commission representing the farm
ers, sent to Mexico City to seek an in
terview with President Lazaro Car
denas, returned with word the ex
ecutive had assured them the small
farmers of the Mexicali Valley would
be given justice.

The most foolhardy of all the tricks
which I can recall in connection with
this carnival of jeering and nonsense
Is one that I have never seen played
Eince I was old enough to require two
digits to express my age. A bag and
two boys were the ingredients of the
trick, and it never failed to 6core a
great success on a quiet side street.
One boy got into the bag and the other
Stood by it waiting for the victim. The
rest of the boys who were "in on the
ground floor" were hiding in hallways
and doors and behind trucks across
the street. An innocent citizen came
W sauntering along. The boy who had
hold of the neck of the bag stopped
him with a "Say, mister, please give
toe a lift, will yer?" The innocent cit
izen usually acquiesced and took hold
of the bag to land it on the youngster's
shoulder. Just as he got it fairly in
his hands the boy in the bag suddenly
kicked and screamed. Innocent vic
tim, thinking it a bagful of wildcats
or hypnas. let go quickly and ran off
with palpitating heart and hair on end.
while all the boys across the street
pursued him with a villainous chorus
of "April fool 1 April fool! Wash
.your face and go to sclioU" or
something to the same effect. It
Talways seemed to me that the joke
was really on the boy in the bag;
he was sometimes dropped hastily
and heavily and was hurtand occa
sionally the April-fooled citizen gave
him a thrashing besides for being too
funny. But it was an effective trick.
and often an old codger lingered in the
shadow on the opposite pavement to
witness and enjoy the sport. You have

TO LESSEN THE DEVTL'S FOOLS.
I am abked for a sentiment concern
ing April Fool's day and pause in the
whirl and rush of a righteous warfare
to say that in my opinion time is far
too valuable and important a factor
for a moment to be lost in foolish jest
ing or senseless joking. The world,
especially in these days, is in far too
critical and dangerous a position, so
cially and religiously, to allow of a
man with average sense to saj' noth
ing of those who have consecrated
brains to indulge in any other than
profitable and upright intercourse.
It is a personal relief to me to feel
that in our ranks seventeen hundred
officers and sixteen thousand unpaid
local workers will be pushing with
might and main of soul an enterprise
which upholds sincerity and the ne
cessity of lessening the devil's fools.
Ballington Booth.
A CHA3IPI0X FOR THE DAT.
Before stating what jokes seem to
me timely, and enjc&abJe ior this
S&-
" WIPE DE FLOOB WID niil."
April Fool's day, I cannot resist th
temptation to say that I think the
spirit of the holiday itself hat always
been singularly misunderstocd. The
day is really to be deemed a pause in
time's serious flight, when folly could
with propriety travesty wisdom, and
set the world smiling. As it is, the
first of April has come to be deemed a
nuisance, wheu its observance is not
don away with entirely. April Fool's
day is sadly in need of soue one to
champion it and xestoi e it to its right
ful place in the calendar. It is not
simply the day on which the boys and
girls may make fools of their elders
with impunity. I suspect that there
was a time when it was regarded
rightly, far away as that time seems
to us now. Then the old people put
aside their serious looks and grew
younger instead of older.
If it takes a wise man to be a fool,
surely April first is the feast day
of the saircs. when thev can act on
Shakcspsare's admonition: "Mingle a
little folly with your wisdom."
As for those jokes which seem to mi
good and appropriate to the dav it
should always be understood that the
element of surprise is the essential
thing. Novelty is wit. Jokes must not
bo cruel pranks, otherwise the day
would ba given up to a general hazing
of everybody. The most successful of
April Fool jokes would be to surprise
one's friends by a change of character.
What a rare joke it would be for the
confirmed miser to bestow a dowry
upon that niece of his who needs only
a little money to marry the lad of her
choice. If all the cranks would put
rside their hobbies for a day, what fun
it would be for the rest of us.
This kind of joke can be carried out
ad finitum and would never fail to bo
successful. Let the tippler remain
sober to-day just as a joke. The skin
flint employer can have a lark with
his clerk by granting that increase of
salary that has been talked about so
long. Let the clergyman I say it
reverently preach a sermon only an
hour long to-day instead of one of
four hours' duration. I am convinced
that the idea would meet with success.
People too old for jokes on April
Fool's day? Xouscnc. Even the gray
heads can have their joke. The repro
bate roue can go to church this morn
ing and explain that it is all a joke on
his part. Many a man is ashamed to do
a good thing because it is so unusual
with him that it would give him un
pleasant prominence. But he can do
it to-day and escape with the admis
sion that it is his April fool joke.</text>

It was both a costly and hair-raising
April fool experience that Walter Mosier
had. Mosier. a young man possessed with
an ambition to learn dentistry, is em
ployed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street den
tist. Walter's bogs occasionally allows
him to putter around the molars of his
customers who are out of funds.
One of thes? occasions arose Friday and
Mosier was delegated to perform the
charity service. The, victim was a boy
about 12 years of age. He was suffering
from an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier de
cided that the nerve must be killed, so
forthwith he filled the cavity in the
troublesome tooth with enough arsenic
to kill a horse and sent the unfortunate
youth home happy.
When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, with
the dignity of a full-fledged dentist, told
his employer of his charity work. Then
Dr. Perkins thought of April fool.
"Say, Mosier." said the dentist, with a
serious look on his features. "I've just
received a telephone message to the ef
fect that the arsenic came out of that
boy's tooth and he swallowed it."
"My God!" exclaimed, the would-be
dentist. lf ls he going to die?"
"Well, the doctors are working on him
now, but they don't think they can save
his life."
"Say. Doc, I'm going to get out of town
before this kid dies. I don't want to get
pinched."
"Well." said Dr. Perkins, with a merry
little twinkle in his eye. "You can suit
yourself about that, but I'd advise you to
stay here. They-can't do any more than
charge you with mupder."
"Murder! Ugh! Don't say that. Dr.
Perkins," retorted Mosier, tearfully. "I
didn't mean to do It. I'll go and take
some arsenic myself."
The crestfallen apprentice spent several
moments of contrition and then he made
up his mind to get out of town. He got
50 cents from Perkins and made haste to
the nearest barber-shop, where he Invest
ed it in a haircut and a Bhave. M osier
gave the tonsorial artist orders to cut
}-is hair to the scalp and Bhave his sprout
ing mustache entirely off, hoping thereby
m disguise himself. The badly frightened
youth then returned to the office to learn
further detnils of his mythical victim's
condition. Dr. Simpson told him th« boy
was worse and Mosfer. started to leave the
office. "Wait a minute." called Perkins.
"Where are you going?'
"God knows where I'll go, but I'll never
go to jail for poisoning- that kid," an
swered the youth.
"You go down to the ferry to-morrow
and if the boy dies I'll telephone to you,"
suggested the doctor.
Mosier slipped out to his mother's
home, borrowed 510 and as early as 1
o'clock yesterday morning he arrived
at the ferry thoroughly disguised to
avoid possible detection. He walked up
and down the cheerless and 'desolate
wharves till morning, and then not hear
ing anything from Dr. Perkins bought a
ticket for Sacramento and stole aboard
the boat like a skulking criminal. On
the train he acted for all the world like
a noted forger crossing the line to Can
ada.
ttosiec confided to a friend before he
left that he would commit BUicide rather
than go to jail, which knowledge tuning
to Dr. Perkins made him decide noi to
cfrty the Josh any further. A message
was sent to the frightened youth, and
he returned to the city. Last night he
set about to drown his troubles in the
flowing bowl.
Garret McEnerney fell a victim to a
deeply laid April Fool plot laid for him
by his "close up" friend Jim O'Brien..
The bulky and brainy man of the law
dropped into O'Briens office, commonly
termed the "Cabinet," yesterday noon to
engage the contractor in a little chat.
"Say. Garret." chipped in O'Brien in
an innocent fashion just when the law
yer was i-xplaining to Jim Nealon the
way to make money, "when did you
stand for that bust over in the Palace?"
"What bust?" queried Mr. McEnerney.
"Why. the file they put in the corridor
of the Palace Hotel this morning," said
O'Brien as seriously as if he was talking
business with a moneyed man who want
ed- to spend a "thou or two" in street
work.
"There must be some mistake?" said
McEnerney. "No sculptor ever chiseled
me."
O'Brien is "close up," and his words
had weight with the man who was so
busy dissolving -the injunction against
Chief Lees that he did not stop to think
of April Fool's day.
"Let's go over, Jim, and take a look at
it," said MeEnernty, and .they both start
ed out tho door. O'Brien had no inten
tion of going over with his friend to seek
What he knew to be a myth, so he con
trived to' be excused In a manner ■ that
would not breed suspicion.
The opportunity presented itself when
Judge Lawlor happened along.
"I'm going to take the Judge on -for a
minute," said O'Brien. "You go over and
look at that yourself and I'll wait for
you."</text>

                <text>Concerning the origin of the name and custom of All fool's day
contributed more to the extermination of
the heathen religion and its priests than
all the collateral aids of fire and sword,
though they were also freely employed.
The continuance of customs— especially
droll ones, which suit the gross taste of
the masses— after the original cause of
them has been removed. Is a very common
occurence. and by many antiquaries It is
firmly believed that "fooling" people on
the Ist of April is simply a perpetuation
of the annual public ridiculing of the old
Druid's and their superstitions.

our April fool usages - were a part.
Origins of a religious nature have been
boldly claimed for April Fools' day by
many writers. An old English antiquary,
writing In 1753. states that the custom of
imposing upon and ridiculing people on
the Ist of April may have an allusion to
the mockery of the Savior of the world
by the Jews. Something like that which
we call making April fools Is practiced
also abroad in Catholic countries on In
nocents' day, on which occasion people
run through all the rooms, making a pre
tended search in and under the beds. In
memory, I believe, of the search made by
Herod for the discovery and the destruc
tion of the child Jesus and of his having
been imposed upon and deceived by the
wise men, who, contrary to his orders
and expectation, "returned to their own
country another way."</text>

                <text>April Fool Kept by All
People.
Gigantic Hoax Was a Complete
Success.
"This Is the first of April,
Hunt the gowk another mile."
From time itruneiuorlal thollrstof
April has been celebrated by all sorts of
hoaxes and playing of pranks. Tho
truo origin of April' Fool Is burled lu
tho dust of centuries and our great
est antiquaries seem unable to throw
any light on tho subject. Nearly all
people however, celebrate this day or
its equivalent and the similarity of
the practice and tho coincidence of
dutes establishes without n doubt In
the minds of authorities ihe fact that
It had an early nnd common origin
among mankind.
Nearly all tho peoples on the Conti
nent celebrate April Fool with pranks
and tricks, and even the Hindoos havo
a festival on tho 31st of March, called
Hull, which coincides vjlth our April
Fool.
Ono of the most popular amusements
on April 1, or All Fools day, as it Is
called, Is tho Rending of persons on
fruitless frrands. Unsophisticated
persons are sent to tho bookstores for
a copy of the "History of Eve's Grand,
mother," or to the chemist's shop for
"pigeon's milk," while small boys arc
sometimes sent to the harness shop for
strap oil, when a liberal dose of this
treatment Is usually administered to
the boy.
There Is a story told to the effect
that Francis, Duko of I,oiTaIne, mid
his wife owed their escape from cap
tivity at NanteH to this popular cus
tom. Arrayed as peasants, they were
makiug their way out. of the territory
when they were discovered by a wo
man who knew them. She Immediate
ly hastened to a guard, and told him"
that the Duko was escaping. "April
Fool," said the guard laughingly,
treating the matter as a joke, and
while he laughed the prisoners made
good tlieir escape
Occasionally a gigantic hoax Is per
petrated on tho people as a whole, and
such a one met 'with groat success in
London in I8RO. Some wag distributed
cards, bearing an official looking seal,
which read: "Tower of London Ad
mit the bearer to vlorv the annual core,
raony of the washing of the white lions
on Sunday, Aprij, 1, 1800. It Is par
ticularly requested that no gratuities
be given to wardens or their assistants.
Admitted only nt tho white gate."
This trick was highly successful,
and people swarmed to tho tower to
view tho washing of tho whlto lions.
NO HELP.
Farmhands Are Not to
be Had
And Are Being Imported From
Other States.
Chagrin Falls, April 1. 'With tho ex
tra work occasioned by sugar making,
nnd the busy season of spring coming
on so early, farmers throughout this
portion of tlie. Western Reserve are
confronted by tho knotty problems of
what arc they going to do for farm la
borers this season.
All through the maple sugar season
they found It almost Impossible to
procure laborers at any price, many
offers of $2 a day and board finding no
takers, and only tho fact that the ma
ple sugar product was not half a crop
this year ennbled the producers to get
through tho season. Many farmers
now say that tho offrr of wages seems
to make no difference, and that farm
laborers cannot bo obtained at any
price they offer.
In this vicinity offers of $22 to ?2S a
month and board, which is a higher
llguro than usually paid, brought no
help and many ngrlculturlstB have sent
south and brought Inboiers from Ken
tucky. The reason for this shortage of help
Is not because of hauler work or more
exacting duties that heretofore, but
on account of tho great army of form
er's boys who havo gono to tho city
to learn trades nnd procure employ
ment during tho past year. If the rush
of farmer boya to tho city continues
tho coming year no it has during tho
past season the farms of this vicinity
will bo practically deserted of all la
borers but those- imported from other
states.</text>

44 jk PEIL Fool' April Tool! Ho! ho!" giggled the creature
who bad frightened tne angry tea pots and cups away.
"They thought the Hammer family was after them. Ho! ho!"
"Well, I'm sure I 'm much obliged," said Wilhelmina. "They
were trying to kill me, and if you had not come along, I would be
dead now
"There they are, right behind you! Bun! run!" screamed
the creature.
Wilhelmina squealed with terror and started to race away, but
the creature roared with laughter and shouted:
"Apr il Tool' April Fool' Oh, goody, goody, goody."
"Oh, I'm so frightened," sobbed Wilhelmina. "My legs are
all trembly I can hardly stand.''
"Well, sit down then," said the creature. "There is some
nice grass right behind you."
Wiihelimna sat down where he pointed and instead of sitting
on grass she found herself flopping into a puddle of bright green
water that covered her an instant.
"Apr il Fool again! Oh, but this is fine!" said the creature,
laughing harshly. "It's too bad, tho, that you are all wet. Come
with me and dry yourself by the fire."
He started off at once at a great pace, and Wilhelmina fol-
lowed as well as she could, which was not so very well, because
he went thru all the brambles and thickets that he could find. At
last she could not "walk any farther, and tumbled flat Then the
creature turned around and laughed again.
"You are awfully easy to fool," said he. "This was another
April Fool, you know. There isn 't any fire in the whole country.''
"Oh, I want to go home," sobbed Wilhelmina.
"Right this way, then," said the creature, pointing straight
ahead
So when Wilhelmina was a little rested she walked and walked
and walked, but the longer she walked the bigger the country
seemed to be. Finally she noticed that she kept seeing the very
same things over and over again and then she happened to look
over her shoulder and there she saw the creature close behind
her, altho she had left him hours ago.
"Oh, but it's fun to have you around," cackled the crea-
ture. "Here you've been going as fast as you could for hours
and you never noticed that this country is made of rubber and
keeps stretching and stretching all the time."
"What country is it, for mercy's sake!" asked Wilhelmina,
frightened almost out of her senses.
"Why the April Fool country, of course," said the creature.
"Well, I guess you will have a fine time of it before you get out,
but I won't stay to watch you. I've got to April Fool somebody
else now."
"With these words he leaped away, and the next thing ^Wil-
helmina knew the rubber country seemed to draw together again
and she was back again just where she had started.
She was terribly hungry by that time, so she picked some
I bought myself an Easter gown
And took a walk thru Tabby-town,
And just as soon as I got there
The people all began to stare.
Arid everyone, I know right well,
Admired more than she could tell,
Except that spiteful Mrs. White,
Who whispered: "Isn't she a sight!"
If Easter time had not been here
I would have scratched her, never fear!
But as it was, I thought: "Oh, scat!
We know she's just a real old cat!'*

nice loking berries that she saw on a bush and began to eat them.
But she had haTdly filled her mouth with them before she wished
she hadn 't, for they were all filled witfr pepper and vinegar. And
while she was trying to get rid of the horrid taste, all the bushes
and grasses seemed to giggle and whisper: _~*
"April Fool! April Fool!"
She got up again and wandered around till__she saw a little
spring and stooped down to take a drink. But the water was
full of Epsom salts. Then she tried to lie down under a bush
and the bush immediately shook itself and shook a whole colony
of red ants over her.
Poor "Wilhelmina -wandered around and around after that,
not daring even to sit down, till it was late in the night and she
was nearly dead. Then the creature eame ambling along and said:
"Well, I've come"to say good-by to you. It's nearly mid-
night and then the first of April will be over. So we are going*to
play the best April Fool of the lot on you for a wind-up.''
He whistled on his fingers and the whole country began to
stretch, till pvexythvng was all stretched out of shape. Suddenly
the clocks began to ring the hour of midnight, and then all at
once the country let go with a snap like a rubber band and off
went Wilhelmina flying thru the air.
"April Fool' ho! April Fool! April Fool'" was the last that
she heard before she fell spang! into a chimney and thru it into a
room where she was received at once with:
"What do you mean by it! What .do you mean by it? How
dare you? Oh, my nerves and sensibilities! Oh, miserable child!
How can you? You make me ilL I cannot bear it and I will not
bear it! I am nearly mad. Who are you? What is your name?
Nice parents you must have' What a disgrace you are to them!"
The woman from whom these words proceeded was prancing
up and down the room excitedly as she spoke, and every time she
approached Wilhelmina she made a dart at her as if she meant
to pull her hair.</text>
